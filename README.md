**Tax Calculator Program:**

This is a simple Python-based tax calculator that allows users to calculate their income tax based on two different tax regimes: Default Tax Regime and Optional Tax Regime. The program takes user inputs for income, age, and tax regime, then calculates the tax based on the selected regime and the given income details.

***Features:***

- Income After Deductions: The program allows users to input their income after deductions.

- Default Tax Regime: A standard tax structure based on income brackets.

- Optional Tax Regime: A tax structure with different slabs depending on the user’s age.

- Interactive User Input: The user is prompted to enter details such as income, age, and preferred tax regime.

- Input Validation: The program ensures that the user inputs valid numeric values for income and age. If invalid input is entered, the program will ask the user to correct it.

***How to Use***

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure Python is installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).

3. Run the Python script tax_calculator.py.

4. Follow the prompts to enter the required details:

  * Income After Deductions: Your total income after all deductions.

  * Age: Your age (used to determine which tax regime applies).

  * Tax Regime: Choose between Default or Optional tax regime by entering 'D' for Default or 'O' for Optional.

  * The program will calculate and display the tax based on the input.
